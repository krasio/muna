Simple Rails app for encrypting secrets so that you can email then, post in Jira, etc...

## Deployment

Most important thing is to deploy and configure the app to work only for HTTPS requests. All that secrets encrypting stuff makes no sense otherwise.

## Configuration

#### Recipients

The application expects list of recipients (comma separated) as `MUNA_GPG_RECIPIENTS` environment variable or it will fail to boot.

#### Public keys

Recipients's public keys can be provided in the following ways:

* `MUNA_GPG_PUBLIC_KEYS` environment variable that contains one or more public keys.  
Example:  
```
MUNA_GPG_PUBLIC_KEYS=`cat gpg/*.pub`
```

* `MUNA_GPG_PUBLIC_KEYS_PATH` environment variable with the path to directory containing the public keys. Only file with `.pub` extension will be imported.
